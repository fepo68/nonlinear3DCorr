    abstract = {{Automated analysis of human affective behavior has attracted increasing attention from researchers in psychology, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, and related disciplines. Promising approaches have been reported, including automatic methods for facial and vocal affect recognition. However, the existing methods typically handle only deliberately displayed and exaggerated expressions of prototypical emotions-despite the fact that deliberate behavior differs in visual and audio expressions from spontaneously occurring behavior. Recently efforts to develop algorithms that can process naturally occurring human affective behavior have emerged. This paper surveys these efforts. We first discuss human emotion perception from a psychological perspective. Next, we examine the available approaches to solving the problem of machine understanding of human affective behavior occurring in real-world settings. We finally outline some scientific and engineering challenges for advancing human affect sensing technology.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;A physiological signal-based emotion recognition system is reported. The system was developed to operate as a user-independent system, based on physiological signal databases obtained from multiple subjects. The input signals were electrocardiogram, skin temperature variation and electrodermal activity, all of which were acquired without much discomfort from the body surface, and can reflect the influence of emotion on the autonomic nervous system. The system consisted of preprocessing, feature extraction and pattern classification stages. Preprocessing and feature extraction methods were devised so that emotion-specific characteristics could be extracted from short-segment signals. Although the features were carefully extracted, their distribution formed a classification problem, with large overlap among clusters and large variance within clusters. A support vector machine was adopted as a pattern classifier to resolve this difficulty. Correct-classification ratios for 50 subjects were 78.4\% and 61.8\%, for the recognition of three and four categories, respectively.}},

@article{RP88,
  abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e.¬†g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.},
