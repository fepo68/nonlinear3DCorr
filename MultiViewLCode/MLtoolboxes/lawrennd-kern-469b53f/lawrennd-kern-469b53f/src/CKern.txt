This file contains classes for representing kernels. These classes do not store the kernel matrix, they merely store the kernels characteristics. There are several types of kernel provided, and it should be easy to add others. CCmpndKern provides a class which forms an additive kernel from individual kernels (i.e. a linear plus an RBF kernel).

16/03/2007 Added code to compute parameter gradients when two X matrices are provided. This enables use of the toolbox with DTC, FITC, PITC approximations. Also changed the transformation of kernel parameters to be by exponential rather than negLogLogit, in line with the default in the MATLAB kern toolbox.

22/10/2005 Added updateX method to class, from William V. Baxter's changes to make computation more efficient. The changes involve precomputing the distance matrix and a portion of the kernel matrix and storing it for later use. UpdateX is called when X has changed so that these stored values are recomputed.

21/10/2005 More changes from William V. Baxter. Most are removal of redundant const modifiers, but also vector<CMatrix*> is now being passed as a reference, rather than by value.

20/10/2005 Incorporated changes from William V. Baxter to allow compilation under MSVC.
